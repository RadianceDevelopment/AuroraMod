The Aurora Mod is still WIP - and currently in Alpha, though it is stable - but will be ice-themed and/or a general mod.
Currently there is an accessory, a few weapons (a "Bricks" system to make Heavy Weapons, more info on the Wiki) and a Mob Soul system (Based on the older version of Ersion, every hostile NPc drops a Soul you can use to make stuff) and several WIP items (They are labeleld and have sprites, but don't function yet)

More info can be found on the Forum Thread and wiki (Wiki is linked to the thread too)
